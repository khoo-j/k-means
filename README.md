# k-means

Sample Carnegie Mellon MSBA coursework on writing the k-means algorithm from scratch

# Exercise
Objective: Create a program to identify images of 10 handwritten digits in the digit dataset. This is a classification exercise.

Caveat: One will need to run K-means without using any machine learning packages. K-means from scratch.

# Approach:
1. Come up with a set of clusters where distance between clusters is large & distance between points within a cluster is small

2. Represent each cluster with a single vector called a 'centroid'

3. Minimize the sum of distances between points & centers of their assigned clusters
